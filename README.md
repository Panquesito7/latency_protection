## Damage mode

This mode attempts to prevent players from glitching through protected nodes, by damaging players who interact with a protected position too fast.

## Teleport mode

This mode attempts to prevent players from glitching through protected nodes, by recording the position every 20 seconds (This can be changed in settings) and teleporting them if the protection interaction happens in a rapid time frame. If a player interacts with a protected node the position will not be recorded for an extra cycle. Before recording a position, the playerâ€™s avg_jitter is checked to make sure the player is not lagging out.

The timer for when to record a player's position.   
This only works if punishment is set to teleport.

```lua
latency_protection.timer = 20
```

The max jitter a player can have before refusing the position update.    
This only works if punishment is set to teleport.

```lua
latency_protection.jitter_max = 1.5
```

The time limit between is_protected calls.    
If the function is called too fast the player will be teleported or damaged.    
`time_max` is read in microseconds.

```lua
latency_protection.time_max = 2000
```

Damage amount to apply to the player.   
This only works if punishment is set to damage.

```lua
latency_protection.damage = 3
```

Set what type of punishment will be given to a player:
- Teleport the player.
- Damage the player.

```lua
latency_protection.punishment = "damage"
```
